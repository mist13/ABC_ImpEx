# ABC_ImpEx

This plugin will run in MuseScore 3.5 and newer.  
It is one of the plugins that are waiting for the rewrite of the MuseScore plugin API to work in version 4.  
Tested on Windows 10 and Linux Mint 20.

It uses abc2xml and xml2abc from [wim.vree.org](https://wim.vree.org/svgParse) to import and export tunes from and to abc notation via MusicXML.  
Download the newest versions and copy them into the plugin's folder.

## Windows
On Windows both the Python and exe versions can be used.  
If you use it with Python, Python has to be in the PATH environment variable.
